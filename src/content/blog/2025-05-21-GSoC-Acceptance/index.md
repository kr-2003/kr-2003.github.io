After 2 years of applying, I am finally accepted into the Google Summer of Code program for 2025! ðŸŽ‰
I will be working on the [xeus-cpp](htpss://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp) project under Compiler Research(Princeton University and CERN-HSF), focusing on implementing debugging support for C++ in Jupyter notebooks(xeus-cpp).
